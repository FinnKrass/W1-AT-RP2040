# W1-AT-RP2040
RP2040 Based PCB for GeonWorks W1-AT.

Features pull up indicator LEDs, low profile components, and ESR protection. 

***First prototype has arrived and is fully functional!!! Aside from some minor silkscreen junk, there are no issues.***

There was a lot of inspiration taken from the Fuyu by Zykrah and SST60 by Dededecline. 
Original design by Yiancar.
